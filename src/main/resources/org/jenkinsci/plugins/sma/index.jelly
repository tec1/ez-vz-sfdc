This Jenkins plugin generates automatically deploys metadata changes to a Salesforce organization based on differences between two commits in Git. Instead of deploying a repository's contents every time a change is made, the plugin can determine what metadata needs to be deployed and deleted and coordinate only those changes. This has the benefit of drastically reducing deployment times and uncoupling the reliance on the package manifest file (package.xml).
